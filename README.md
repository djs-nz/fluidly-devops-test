# Fluidly DevOps Test
Firstly, thanks for taking the time to do our technical test. There are no trick questions here, we are just looking for you to do what you do best and provide us an example of your work in a simplified context.

Please don't modify this repo - fork it and make any changes locally. Send us the link to your finalised repo.

## Technical Test
Here we have a basic hello-world style node server. The exercise is to deploy it to the cloud as you would any production service, explaining any and all decisions that are made along the way.

### Requirements
- Deploy to a cloud provider (Any is fine).
- Production ready! 

## Technical Questions
Please answer the following questions in a mardown file called Answers.md

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? Why that length of time?
2. Describe why you made the choices that you did. What would you do differently? 
3. What did you enjoy most about this exercise?
4. What is the most useful bit of tech you have used recently?
